# 4-BitBinaryAdder
An electronics circuit to perform the basic addition of two 4-bit inputs designed on a PCB

The circuit was designed around the basic binary adder concept.

## IC Components 
Logical AND Gate: IC7408

Logical OR Gate: IC7432

Logical XOR Gate: IC7486

## Notes by the Creator
This design isn't fully optimal, in particular PCB traces are capable of optimisations. It was the first full circuit design and PCB design endeavoured by myself and hence useful as a bedrock for future developments and projects with lots to learn from.
